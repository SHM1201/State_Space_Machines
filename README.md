# Exploring SSMs for Vision Tasks
This was a project for the course High-Level Computer Vision SoSe'24 at Saarland University. In this project we analyzed the performance of the VMamba model across various transformations and compared it with the performances of Swin-Transformer and ConvNeXt on these transformations. We have also fine-tuned the UMamba model on an Image Segmentation Dataset using PEFT-LoRA.
